BarCamp Boston 4 has been a lot of fun. This post is just a roundup of the talks I went to on Sunday. I did give a talk about getting started with git, which seems to have went well.

I've never been to MIT before, and I need to come back and explore the campus more. It was held in the MIT Strata center, which is absolutely ridiculous. The architecture is really just unreal. Also, I can't believe how much pizza a few hundred nerds can down in a manner of minutes.

One of the neatest things was that a project was being run in the hallway with a "Wiffiti":http://wiffiti.com stream of the tweets, pictures, and more that was going on:

Here's the talks I went to and what I got out of them. You can see the "full schedule here":http://wiki.barcampboston.org/index.php?title=2009_Schedule.

*how to be a freelancer*

The person giving this talk wanted to hit like 8 points, but I think he only got to 3. What ensued was plenty of discussion on how to deal with clients, how to ditch them, and problems that come up with freelancing in general. The general gist I got from it: I'm glad I don't have to deal with that.

*Code secrets*

This was a great idea: people in the audience write down horrible, deep, dark secrets about code they've written, and then they're read off. Hilarity ensued.

*Starting a Boston startup space*

Sadly I didn't pay too much attention to this one, but my basic gist was that it's a community service, and it's tough to decide a business model that works for the people you're serving. I'll definitely be utilizing the local coworking if I end up on the lam as a freelancer or mobile worker after school is over.

*Fun with QR Codes*

QR codes are really neat, and can do some ridiculous stuff. They're really awesome for embedding URLs into the real life, like putting a QR code near a bus stop that can open a schedule for you. I just wish my phone didn't suck so I could actually read them. I do wonder how this concept would catch on with the general public. What is really funny is to watch people try to read the QR code on their phones from the screen.

*JavaScript Testing Discussion*

Lots of gripes about the current state of testing JS in the browser. There's plenty of ways to DO testing in the browser, but there doesn't seem to be a be-all, end-all solution. Listing out various testing frameworks, but there doesn't seem to be many familiar with most of them. Complaints, bitching and moaning about how difficult this situation is. It all boils down to not being able to remove the human element from testing it correctly.
