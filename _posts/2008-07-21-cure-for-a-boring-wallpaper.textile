Does your computer's wallpaper look like one of these?
<table style="text-align: center;" border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img title="xp" src="http://litanyagainstfear.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/xp.jpg" alt="" /></td>
<td><img title="osx" src="http://litanyagainstfear.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/osx.jpg" alt="" /></td>
<td><img title="vista" src="http://litanyagainstfear.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/vista.jpg" alt="" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
If so, then chances are your wallpaper might have a severe case of boredom. Luckily, I have the perfect cure: spruce up your desktop with some awesome photos from a few websites, or perhaps your own! Your mind and your computer will be a LOT cleaner and organized when you change your desktop...
<p style="text-align: center;">...from this (tons of clutter, how can you find anything?)

What, you don't know how to change your wallpaper? It's easy! Just drag your favorite photo into your internet browser, right click, and Set as Background. If that isn't working, here's some tutorials on how to do just that if you're on <a href="http://www.homeandlearn.co.uk/BC/bcs1p11.html">XP</a>, <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/help/2959a6e9-4b0c-4e36-8d63-a15bd50b8f5f1033.mspx">Vista</a>, or <a href="http://www.timalosi.com/wallpaperhowtomac">OSX</a>. Today I'm also going to share a few of my favorite wallpaper sites and feature a few select photo-based wallpapers.

<a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/downloads/date/any/">InterfaceLIFT</a> hosts a broad range of wallpapers, icons, and themes. I really love how they provide their wallpapers for nearly every resolution, even dual monitors and mobile phones! They have a fantastic array of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range_imaging">high dynamic range (HDR) images</a> that really bring out colors in scenes that you've never seen before in a digital picture. Some great examples of wallpapers can be found here: <a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/details/1625/dark_clouds_await.html">Dark Clouds Await by sn0dig</a>, <a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/details/1605/syrphid_fly.html">Syrphid Fly by Niels Strating</a>, <a href="http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/details/1580/giants_causeway.html">Giants Causeway by RGH Photography</a>

<a href="http://wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?libid=8&amp;cat=Photography">WinCustomize</a> also has a huge wallpaper gallery with a fantastic photography section. Although most downloads only come in one size, searching for your favorite subject or sorting by downloads delivers quite a few high-quality photos: <a href="http://wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=30943&amp;libid=8">Rock Face by AzDude</a>, <a href="http://wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=28078&amp;libid=8">Rainforest Leaves by thecoolcrocodile</a>, <a href="http://wincustomize.com/skins.aspx?skinid=32800&amp;libid=8">ZuBench by Zubaz</a>

<a href="http://deviantart.com">DeviantART</a>, which has one of the largest art communities on the web, hosts not only a normal <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/photography/">photography section</a> but also a huge wallpaper section with categories like <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/wallpaper/scenery/">Landscapes and Scenery</a>, <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/wallpaper/photomanip/">Photo Manipulated</a>, and <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/wallpaper/architecture/">Cities &amp; Structures</a>. Browsing through their galleries is a breeze, just make sure to click on the "All Time" sort for the real goodies: <a href="http://tonyelieh.deviantart.com/art/Remains-86510953">Remains by tonyelieh</a>, <a href="http://burning-liquid.deviantart.com/art/The-World-in-my-Eyes-22985143">The World in my Eyes by Burning-Liquid</a>, <a href="http://angelreich.deviantart.com/art/Silence-of-The-Storm-49973507">Silence of The Storm by angelreich</a>
