Welcome to the blog of Nick Quaranto! This is where I hope I can share a bit of my life with some added spice on my little corner of the internet. <a href="/contact.html">Want to get a hold of me?</a>

Oh yeah, what is the <a href="http://alcoman.railfan.net/fear.html">Litany Against Fear</a>? It's from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)">Dune novels by Frank Herbert</a>:

p=. *I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
Only I will remain.*
